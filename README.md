# A Deep Dive into the Causes of Absenteeism Using Human Resource Data"

## Description 

The company's manager has detected a drop in team performance, with absenteeism emerging as the primary culprit upon closer examination. A thorough analysis is now needed to identify successful approaches for addressing absenteeism and reinstating peak team productivity.

## Features 

We used powerBi to explore the given dataset to uncover relationships between the rate of absenteeism and work related factors or employee related factors and then created an interactive dashboard. DAX was also used to create new features to pinpoint correctly the possible reasons for the increased rates of absenteeism and if the increased rates had a particular trend. <br> 

## Tools Used

* PowerBi
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Result 

After proper analysis, a dashboard was built by the team which can be seen below:

## Conclusion

It was discovered that most people who were absent most of the times where of a certain age range, and the larger number of employees were of this age range, The company's workforce consisted of mainly high school certificate holders who might be less professional, We also discovered that the absenteesim peak was in Spring. The social life of workers also contributed to the level of absenteeism. The following recommendations were made to the company:

* Optimize workload distribution during spring because workers tend to want to take breaks during spring.
* Review employment policies to reflect intake of more skilled personnel. 
* Organize awareness programs to encourage healthy lifestyle.
* Deploy discplinary measures that are more strict for defaulters and occassional incentives for complying employees. <br>
